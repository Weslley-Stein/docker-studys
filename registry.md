# What's Registry?

Basically Registry its a way to storage your images on a local repo, Docker Hub it's a registry, where you can storage your images on Web/Cloud, but if you want, you can storage then locally, let's take a look:

### Creating a Registry

```docker
docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry --restart=always registry:2
docker image tag <imageID> localhost:5000/image-name
docker push localhost:5000/image-name 	
```

### Explanation
1. You are creating your registry(which is a container in fact) 
2. You are tagging your image(exactly as you would make for a remote repo)
3. You are pushing your image for your local repo(which is the registry)
