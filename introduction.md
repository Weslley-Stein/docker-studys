#What's a Container?

Basically a container is an isolation, a physical isolation(CPU, Memory, Disk) and also logical(Processes, users and even network) which is possible
thanks to three Kernel Modules of Linux, Namespaces(who isolate the processes), Cgroups(who isolate the computational resources) and Netfilter(who isolate thenetwork)
